import { Meta, Story, Preview } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";

import ParallaxSection from ".";

<Meta title="MDX/Parallax" component={ParallaxSection} />

# Loader

Let's define a story for our `Loader` component:

<Story name="default">
  <ParallaxSection />
</Story>

### Props

<Props of={ParallaxSection} />

### Sizes

We can even preview multiple stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories
with unique URLs and isolated snapshot tests.
